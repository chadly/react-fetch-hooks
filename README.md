# React Fetch Hooks

> A set of react hooks to work with the fetch API and gracefully parse & deal with HTTP errors.

```js
const { isFetching, isFetched, error, body } =
		useFetch(`https://api.example.com/`);
```

or

```js
const { isFetching, isFetched, error, body: result, fetch: saveThing } =
		useLazyFetch(`https://api.example.com/`, {
			method: "POST"
		});

// ...later, maybe in response to a user action
saveThing();
```

See more [in-depth examples](#examples).

## Install

```
npm install react-fetch-hooks
```

This library makes use of and assumes the [`fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is available on the global scope. You will need to polyfill it if it is not available in the current environment.

### Polyfill the Browser

All evergreen browsers already support `fetch`. You should really only need a polyfill if you want this library to work in IE ðŸ¤®. See the [full support matrix for `fetch`](https://caniuse.com/#search=fetch).

Try using [Github's `fetch` polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch) or add a reference to [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/) if you decide you need to polyfill.

### Polyfill the Server

If using this library in node, make use of the [`node-fetch` library](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) to polyfill `fetch`:

```js
global.fetch = require("node-fetch");
```

Do that at the beginning of the entry point for your app and then you can use `react-fetch-hooks` as normal.

## Examples

```js
import React from "react";
import { useFetch } from "react-fetch-hooks";

const MyBanana = ({ id }) => {
	const { isFetching, isFetched, error, body: banana } =
		useFetch(`https://api.example.com/bananas/${id}`);

	if (isFetching) {
		return <span>Loading...</span>;
	}

	if (error) {
		// the error message will be parsed from the HTTP response, if available
		return <span>Some shit broke: {error}</span>;
	}

	return <span>My banana is {banana.color}!</span>;
};
```

This will make a `GET` request to `api.example.com` whenever the `id` prop passed to the component changes. It will then return the status of the response body being loaded as well as the body itself when it is ready. The `useFetch` hook takes all the same parameters/options as the [standard fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

### Lazy Evaluation

You can also use the hook to lazily create a function that can be invoked later:

```js
import React from "react";
import { useLazyFetch } from "react-fetch-hooks";

const BananaEditor = ({ color }) => {
	const { isFetching: isSaving, error, fetch: saveBanana } =
		useLazyFetch({
			url: "https://api.example.com/bananas/",
			method: "POST",
			body: JSON.stringify({ color })
		});

	if (isSaving) {
		return <span>Saving...</span>;
	}

	if (error) {
		return <span>Some shit broke: {error}</span>;
	}

	return <button onClick={saveBanana}>Save new banana with color: {color}</button>;
};
```

This will not invoke the fetch until the button is clicked.

Or, if you want the request body to come from the lazy function's parameters:

```js
import React from "react";
import { useLazyFetch } from "react-fetch-hooks";

const BananaEditor = ({ color }) => {
	const { isFetching: isSaving, error, fetch: saveBanana } =
		useLazyFetch({
			url: "https://api.example.com/bananas/",
			method: "POST"
		});

	if (isSaving) {
		return <span>Saving...</span>;
	}

	if (error) {
		return <span>Some shit broke: {error}</span>;
	}

	return <button onClick={() => saveBanana({ color })}>Save new banana with color: {color}</button>;
};
```

This is equivalent to the example above except the request body is provided to the lazy function rather than at the time of hook creation.

### Polling on an Interval

You can pass a `refreshInterval` parameter to any of the fetch hooks to refresh the data (do the fetch again) after a certain amount of time has passed. This could be useful to poll the server changes on a set interval:

```js
import React from "react";
import { useFetch } from "react-fetch-hooks";

const MyBanana = ({ id }) => {
	const { body: banana } = useFetch({
		url: `https://api.example.com/bananas/${id}`,
		refreshInterval: 10000
	});

	if(!banana) return null;
	return <span>My banana is {banana.color}!</span>;
};
```

This will make a `GET` request and update the data from the server every 10 seconds.

### Reset Fetched Data

You can pass a `resetDelay` parameter to any of the fetch hooks to reset the data after a certain amount of time has passed. This could be useful to clear the "saved" flag after a short amount of time:

```js
import React from "react";
import { useLazyFetch } from "react-fetch-hooks";

const BananaEditor = ({ color }) => {
	const { isFetching: isSaving, isFetched: isSaved, fetch: saveBanana } =
		useLazyFetch("https://api.example.com/bananas/", {
			method: "POST",
			body: JSON.stringify({ color }),
			resetDelay: 3000
		});

	if (isSaving) {
		return <span>Saving...</span>;
	}

	if (isSaved) {
		return <span>You just saved a great banana! Congrations to you!</span>;
	}

	return <button onClick={saveBanana}>Save new banana with color: {color}</button>;
};
```

This will clear the `isSaved` flags 3 seconds after the `POST` finishes successfully.

### Conditional Fetching

Since you [shouldn't wrap your hooks in conditionals](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html), if you want to conditionally fetch, you can pass a `null` or empty URL to the hook which will tell it not to do anything:

```js
import React from "react";
import { useFetch } from "react-fetch-hooks";

const MyBanana = ({ id }) => {
	const { body: banana } = useFetch(id ? `https://api.example.com/bananas/${id}` : null);

	if (!banana) return null;
	return <span>My banana is {banana.color}!</span>;
};
```

This will only make the `GET` request when a valid `id` has been passed to the component. Any of the following will also accomplish the same result:

```js
// all of these will do nothing
useFetch();
useFetch("");
useFetch({
	url: null,
	headers: {
		"Content-Type": "application/json"
	}
});
useFetch({
	// missing URL
	headers: {
		"Content-Type": "application/json"
	}
});
```

### Bearer Tokens

You can pass specific headers to the hook but setting an _Authorization_ header with a `bearerToken` is one we use often enough that we built in a shortcut for it:

```js
import React from "react";
import { useFetch } from "react-fetch-hooks";

const MyBanana = ({ id, authToken = "mytoken" }) => {
	const { body: banana } = useFetch(`https://api.example.com/bananas/${id}`, {
		bearerToken: authToken
	});

	if (!banana) return null;
	return <span>My banana is {banana.color}!</span>;
};
```

This will make a `GET` request adding an `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer mytoken`. `bearerToken` can also be a `Promise`, a `function`, or a `function` that returns a `Promise` (an `async function`) and the hook will wait for the `bearerToken` to resolve before making the request.
